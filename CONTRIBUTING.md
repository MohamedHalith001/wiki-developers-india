# Contributing to developersIndia wiki

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰ Make sure you follow
below guidelines before contributing.

## What qualifies as a "wiki"?

### FAQs

1. Questions that are repeatedly asked on our subreddit (or discord). E.g _"How
   to prepare yourself for a product job"_ or _"How to switch from service based
   to a product-based job"_.
2. FAQs are highly valuable to the community & we expect you to constantly
   update them as time changes.
3. While adding insightful posts & comments from the community, make sure you
   follow below guidelines:
   - Follow the pattern of the existing FAQs.
   - Always make sure the content is relevant to the topic. If a category for
     FAQs doesn't exist, create a proposal with the necessary posts/comments
     that can belong to it.
   - Always make sure the content is not offensive. If moderators have removed a
     post, avoid linking any content from it.
   - Avoid linking any comments that are "reactions" to the post (E.g. _congrats
     OP_, _I'm in same situation_, etc).
   - Avoid linking any comments that are "follow-up" questions to a post. Only
     link direct answers to the post.
   - Add comments that are are insightful, these usually have a lot of upvotes
     or 1-2 paragraphs or points of detailed advice.

### Community Guides

1. Long text guides which will help developersIndia (or the tech community) in
   general. You can suggest ideas by creating a proposal. A nice example would
   be _"How to improve your productivity as a developer"_. Go very niche with
   the topic.
2. Basically these are guides that are not FAQs but are still very helpful to
   the community. Avoid proposing tutorials, like how to create a HTMX app.
3. Try to make you wiki as detailed as possible. We don't expect you to know
   everything.
4. Your intention while writing a wiki should be to think of the community as a
   whole.
5. Try to avoid any personal opinions. Try to be as close as possible towards
   facts.

## Process of contributing a wiki

1. You create a
   [wiki proposal](https://github.com/developersIndia/wiki/issues/new/choose)
   with an intention to work on it.
2. Community Members review your proposal & ask/suggest any follow ups.
3. You take your time to write this wiki. We use markdown for writing and vale
   for prose linting.
4. You create a PR mentioning the issue no.
5. One (or more) community members from our team reviews your Wiki. You fix any
   issues (grammar etc)
6. Once the PR is merged. We announce the new wiki addition on our subreddit
   (and discord).
