## Perspectives & advice from the community

`u/user501230` on a post titled [Does anyone use Deel for payroll management?](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/osk5u1/does_anyone_use_deel_for_payroll_management/) shared the following advice on **working with overseas clients**:

<blockquote>

Hi folks, so I am using Deel for last 4 months now so this is going to be the long post as I will cover every important thing which is needed for one to be employed by overseas companies. I went through lots of hassle to understand how this entire system works. Here are some points from me:

1. **Deel**: The Deel Inc is an US based company and it helps companies in hiring/contracting people overseas. In India, Deel is registered as Deel EOR PVT LTD.
Read here to know more about EOR. Deel platform is intuitive and easy to use. My employer uses it to for my payroll management. It helps employer to share the contract with employee/contractor. Once you and employer agree on the employment terms you can sign the contract. The Deel will auto-generate an invoice for you based on the terms in your contract and share it with employee and transfer the money to your Deel wallet. Deel wallet(it's free) is nothing but a place where it shows how much money you have earned. Having money parked in your Deel account does not mean money has reached to you. One has to withdraw the money in his/her bank account. You select a payment method to withdraw the amount from the different payment options that are provided by Deel. I will come back to you on why you should add your bank account and in payment method later. For India, Deel does not handle tax compliance so you are on your own. As of today, there are two health insurance options available on Deel platform for Indians but both are useless.
1. **Taxation**: When you are working for an overseas company you are providing them your services and billing them(remember auto-generated invoices on Deel in above sections) and that's where taxation gets complicated. Now you will be entitled to pay GST(Goods and Services Tax) along with income tax. Yes, both GST and income tax. Before you get disappointed by the taxes let me tell you as of now, export of Goods and Services are taxed at 0% i.e. you will pay ZERO GST. Although you don't have to pay GST, you will have file GST every month. Sounds funny but that leads us to next part i.e. Compliance.
2. **Compliance**: So far you know you have to file GST even though you will be exporting your services and are entitled for zero GST. As you have to pay GST, you will need a good CA who does GST registration and files it on your behalf. CA will be responsible for your entire taxation and compliance work. Find a CA you know or people recommend. I personally feel if your CA asks for more 40k/year, consider a different CA.
Your CA will handle everything from taxation to compliance but it's good to understand the taxation and compliance relevant for you. It will help you make wise decisions as it's your money. Let's begin certain important points:
1. You will have to register for GST which takes around two weeks of all the documents are fine. Sometimes more documents and clarity is asked from GST team and that will make the GST registration process longer, good thing is without GST you can take 20 lakhs INR in your account. in respect to Deel, you will keep working for your company and raise invoice bi-weekly/monthly and get paid in your Deel wallet. After you have pulled(withdrawn) 20 lakh INR from your Deel wallet to your bank account you ave to stop and sort out your GST registration.
2. FIRC(Foreign Inward Remittance Certificate) this is one of the most important compliance documents. As you will receive money from foreign hence it is important for authorities to know the purpose of receiving foreign fund. FIRC document is provided by banks when you receive foreign fund(your salary in this case), this document contains all the relevant details like sender and it's address, receiver and it's address, amount, currency exchange rate, purpose code, etc. Each time you receive foreign fund you will have to get an FIRC for the same from your bank.
FIRC can be issued by banks only thus it is important to add your bank account on the Deel for withdrawing money from your Deel wallet.
Most of the banks do not provide FIRC so choose some correct bank which does it. For example , SBI has very good exchange rate(dollar to rupees) but they told me they would provide only one FIRC per Financial year but I needed FIRC everytime I received money so I went ahead with HDFC bank. I opened a current account in HDFC and they provide me FIRC every time I receive money their currency exchange rate is almost 80p less than SBI but I negotiated well and got +50p on current day's exchange rate.

1. If your annual salary is less than 50 lakh rupees you will be entitled to claim presumptive tax. For annual income more than 50 lakh you will have to get your income audited by CA. Either ways you will have a CA to take care of it. I recommend reading presumptive tax.
2. You will have to pay Advance Income Tax every quarter.
