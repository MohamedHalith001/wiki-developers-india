## Perspectives & advice from the community

`u/DistributionSad2038` shared the following advice on a post titled, [Is gap of 1 year is really bad?](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/189wro2/is_gap_of_1_year_is_really_bad/):

<blockquote>

What will happen is you won't be the most desirable candidate. Now you have to explain the reason of your gap to the hr there are three replies that I saw work the best:

1. I was intentionally looking for a job in my field however I did keep myself abreast with (put recent technical advancements) and I did do some (add courses) to help contribute more in the professional world
2. I had to fight against personal battles and hence that took a priority but now that I am back I am ready to give my hundred percent towards my career
3. I was having another course of plans specifically masters planned in my pocket but after my research I did see that experience and skills matter more and hence Im trying to get hands on experience to get a job.

Secondly, I will suggest you to message the hrs of companies (small bigstartps ) on LinkedIn

And thirdly, I would suggest you to find some internships or projects on wellfound, indeed, etc

You ca do this
