shared the following advice:

<blockquote>

Just drop a formal email/talk to the HR, something along these lines: Hey, thank
you so much for offering me the job for the position X, but recently I have been
made another offer which, after careful consideration, is what I will be going
forward with. Therefore, I would like to forfeit the offer from your
organization. This is purely because I feel that the other offer is more aligned
with my short and long term career aspirations. I deeply regret any
inconveniences my decision might cause.

<blockquote>

As someone who did this once many years ago. If I could go back, I won't do it again. It's a small world and even smaller industry. You don't want to be seen as unprofessional.

If I had to do it again:

- Accept that it's your mistake. I negotiated in bad faith knowing that I was going to get multiple offers. I didn't have to accept any of them but I didn't want to miss an opportunity. But that's the wrong way of looking at it.
- Let them know as soon as possible. The more you delay it, the more painful it'll be. Do not wait until your joining date. Give them enough time to find someone else for the role.
- Have an honest 1:1 conversation with the hiring manager before sending an email rejecting their offer. Convey it over a phone call at least if you can't say it in person. Then send them an email (cc recruiter, etc.) and reject the offer. Don't give any justification here. It should be short and simple. Don't go into any detail of where you're joining or reasons for rejecting.
- Be thankful to them for the offer. They probably rejected other candidates to write you an offer. It'll probably take them many months to years to find another suitable candidate for the position.
- Do not break any bridges. If they gave you an offer today, there's a high chance they'll give you an offer in the future, if you don't break the bridge.
- Be ready to listen to a small lecture (depends on the hiring manager). But you can keep it short and end it on good terms.

Finally, it's not the end of the world. It's not an ideal situation for any party involved. They'll find someone else, eventually. You might regret it in the long run. But everybody moves on.

`u/imaburneracc` on a now deleted post titled [What is the best way to reject offer after accepting?](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1d4yt3c/what_is_the_best_way_to_reject_offer_after/), shared the following advice:

<blockquote>

Be straight and direct. Be polite but firm. If you received some onboarding kit or materials, ask them how you can return them, document your messages and whatever the HR does. It could be that they'll be pissed since they are losing a candidate and make threats like blacklisting and stuff but don't bother and document it (in case they do something to jeapordize your new job) or they'd be understanding and you can part ways normally.

In any case, don't feel guilty because a company won't think twice before removing you for their selfish reasons, and so don't succumb to the dilemma or any of HR's threats if they resort to that. Act in good faith, document their actions so if things go bad, you have ammo.
