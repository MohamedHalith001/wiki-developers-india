# Negotiating notice periods

[Lied about my Notice period before interview now f\*\*ked](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1b875sd/lied_about_my_notice_period_before_interview_now/)
shared the following advice:

<blockquote>

Tell the recruiter that you have a good working relationship with your current
manager and that he’s requesting for 45-60 days to ensure smooth transition.
Tell that he wanted to retain you with salary revision but you refused as you’ve
decided to move on. So, out of kindness for his gesture you’d like to complete
the transition the way he has requested.

This shows that you’re definitely going to leave the current org and not stay
back, you’re a nice person work with even when parting ways, and that you have a
good work ethic that you put ppl first. The recruiter and more so the new hiring
manager would appreciate this.

This has helped me in the past when I wanted a couple of weeks of breathing time
before I switch to a new org.

`u/rajath_naik` on a post titled [People with 90 days notice period and no buyout how do you switch?](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1gccqao/people_with_90_days_notice_period_and_no_buyout/), shared the following advice:

<blockquote>

This usually works for me. First, Start applying to companies/responding to reschouts that you are okay to loose the offer from, sort of like test ground companies. This should be done from day one of interview prep. They'll usually help prepare you for the interviews and build some confidence. These companies should be easy to crack and won't take much effort. While doing so, tell them you have less than a month of notice and you are an immediate joiner. This will help with offer confirmation sooner.

Second, the moment you get an offer from these companies, even if it's just one offer, you can drop papers. The reason to wait for this offer is sort of psychological and it's a huge confidence boost. Once you win one, you'll feel good and it'll act as a backup in the worst case possible. But you'll have to resist the urge to settle and always remind yourself to go back to preparation.

Third, you keep giving interviews until you reach the list of companies that you actually want to join, sort of in a tier list of companies, going towards the top. This list can be personal based on WFH, Package, city etc.. Here, you don't want to lie. You put your 100%. Usually you would have reduced your notice period significantly by then, along with a few backup offers towards the end, where the notice you mentioned is not too drastic, than your actual notice. You don't have a chance to negotiate with your old company because they are in a lose position anyway. But you can definitely negotiate a week or 2 extension on your joining date with new company .

Tldr: use the gap between joining dates of bad companies you don't want to join as a filler till your notice is close. Then apply to good companies.

Note: this is not a hack towards your preparation. Nothing can discount preparation. This is just a hedge towards a rigged game of hiring.
