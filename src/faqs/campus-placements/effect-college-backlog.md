## Perspectives & advice from the community

`u/Adventurous_Top_4993` shared the following advice on a post titled [What will be the impact of having a backlog on my career as a fresher?](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1cj0bsn/what_will_be_the_impact_of_having_a_backlog_on_my/):

<blockquote>

Some companies in placement have a criteria where u should never have any arrears (Be it cleared or not).
Its called "History of arrears". Some companies want history of arrears to be 0 to even attend their first round.
An arrear gives a black mark in ur placement journey. so try not to get arrears and questions ur consistency so try to complete ur degree without any backlogs. A backlog will always stay in ur profile even if u clear them.

what is the difference between standing arrears and history of arrears in engineering? Standing arrears means current backlog or in simple words do you have any backlog at present where as history of arrears means during your entire course period the number of backlog you have.

Do well! Cheers!
